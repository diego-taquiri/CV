My current research focus is on bioinformatics and genomics. I am interested in applying and developing computational methods to address research questions centered around biological sequences such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. I am also exploring the use of machine learning and generative AI in biology to enhance our understanding of the "language of life."

### Research Interests

- **Gene Regulation:** Predicting gene regulatory mechanisms from DNA sequences.
- **Genetic Variants:** Predicting the effects of genetic variants on diseases and protein function.
- **Protein Function:** Annotating the protein universe and detecting remote homologies, especially in metagenomics.
- **Gene Expression:** Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to understand cellular function and tissue organization.
- **Genomics/Protein Language Models:** Integrating large language models to predict biological phenomena at scale.
- **Synthetic Biology:** Designing functional DNA sequences and predicting their activity.
- **Human Diseases:** Understanding disease mechanisms to develop better treatments.
